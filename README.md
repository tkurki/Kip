# Kip

This is an instrumentation package to display Signal K data. Display can be split up in any arrangement to show all data available on the server.

## Design Goal

The idea is to replicate the functionality of your average MFD such as the B&G Triton, Raymarine i70, or Garmin GMI20. Display should be fullscreen and not require any scrolling, and anything displayed should be as big as possible in the given space. Multiple pages

## Developing

The app is an Angular-cli app. Install dependencies with `npm install`. Then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `public/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build. To prepare for npm, run `npm run-script build-npm`.
